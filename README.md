## Overview

Spoonful is a service and mobile app designed to bridge the gap between households and food kitchens. Our mission is to reduce food waste and support community sharing through a convenient platform. With Spoonful, users can:

- **Donate excess food** easily to local food kitchens.
- **Track the impact** of their donations and see how they're helping the community.
- Receive **personalized spending analytics** to understand food spending habits better.
- **Earn rewards** for philanthropic actions, encouraging a culture of giving.

Our ultimate goal is to improve food management practices, enabling users to save money while contributing to a noble cause. Future plans include launching a reimbursement program to further incentivize donations.
