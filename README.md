This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) deployed by vercel.

Project overview:
Spoonful is a service and mobile app connecting households with food kitchens, allowing users to donate excess food, track its impact, receive personalized spending analytics, and earn rewards for their philanthropy. To address the problem of inadequate food management, users of the app will receive personalized data analytics and cost saving strategies to retain more of their limited disposable income. In the far future, we aim to generate enough revenue to launch a reimbursement program based on donation size, while continuing to provide recommendations, news, recipes, and other incentives for user engagement.
